# Calculator-
Web-based calculator. Simple project created  during my Web Development course using Node.js + Express.js. 

This project is a simple web-based calculator built using HTML, JavaScript and Node.js, with the Express framework and Body-Parser middleware. The user inputs the two numbers into the HTML form, which is then posted to the server. The server uses the Body-Parser middleware to extract the numbers from the request body, calculates the sum, and returns the result to the user. The front-end is implemented using HTML and the back-end is implemented using JavaScript and the Express framework.
